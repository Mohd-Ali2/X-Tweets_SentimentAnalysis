## Introduction

Sentiment analysis is a crucial task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text. This project leverages tweets to build a sentiment analysis model that can help understand public opinion and trends on social media.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains tweets labeled with their respective sentiment (positive, negative, neutral). It can be found on Kaggle or other open data repositories.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


git clone https://github.com/yourusername/x-tweets-sentiment-analysis.git
cd x-tweets-sentiment-analysis

Model Training
The model training script trains a sentiment analysis model using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, SVM, or a simple neural network. The script train.py handles the training process.

Evaluation
The evaluation script evaluate.py assesses the performance of the trained model on a test dataset and outputs metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Results
The results of the sentiment analysis model will be displayed in terms of the aforementioned metrics. Visualization of the results can be found in the notebooks/EDA.ipynb notebook.
